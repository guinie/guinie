# Guinie

Guinie is a set of libraries of GUI testing utilities, enabling the definition of composeable UI interaction sequences that are runnable in various UI testing contexts.

## Mission

Guinie provides UI automation and testing tools for agile practitioners.

The libraries share common interfaces to enable the definition of context-agnostic sequences of interaction. The sequences are further composable with each other to produce more complex behavior.

Guinie is intended to serve a wide audience â€“ developers, testers, product owners etc.. It should prove especially useful for anyone who fills more than one role in an agile software project.
