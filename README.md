<blockquote>
  <p>
    Guinie asked the weary Journeyman for what she needed the most.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Something to help me verify the behavior of my components...", the Journeyman began.
  </p>
  <p>
    "...Something to help me compose more complex behavior. And to help me describe the current status of a system".
  </p>
  <p>
    Guinie drew words and diagrams in the air and then disappeared. The Journeyman was left with a vague memory of Guinie and the wisdom with which he was trusted with for a brief moment.

Guinie is a set of libraries of GUI testing utilities, enabling the definition of composeable UI interaction sequences that are runnable in various UI testing contexts.

## Mission

Guinie provides UI automation and testing tools for agile practitioners.

The libraries share common interfaces to enable the definition of context-agnostic sequences of interaction. The sequences are further composable with each other to produce more complex behavior.

Guinie is intended to serve a wide audience â€“ developers, testers, product owners etc.. It should prove especially useful for anyone who fills more than one role in an agile software project.
