## Install

```
npm install @guinie/selenium-interactions
```

## Usage

Although not strictly enforced, the functions exposed by this library should try to produce a uniform API for all interactions in order to maintain easy client implementations. Therefore, the functions should have the following shape:

```
(webDriver[, element[, ...params]]) => element

or

(webDriver[, ...params]) => webDriver
```

Following these function shapes, the functions may be used by the client as follows, for example:

```
const scrollableContainer = await driver.findElement(By.id('list-container'))
await seleniumActions.scrollDown(driver, scrollableContainer)
```

## API

### click

```
(webDriver, element) => element
```

Click on the element

### type

```
(webDriver, element, text) => any
```

Type text into the element

### scroll

```
(webDriver, start, end) => any
```

Scroll



### scrollUp
### scrollDown
### scrollLeft
### scrollRight
